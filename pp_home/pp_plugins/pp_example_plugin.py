ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
-----------------------------------
The idea for plugins came from 2-sidedtoast on the Raspberry Pi forum
His original module at code.google.com/p/python-weather-images/ used a program separate from
Pi Presents and initiated by Cron to write the image to the liveshow directory.

I have integrated his idea into Pi Presents such that you can call a plugin from imageplayer, videoplayer, audioplayer, messageplayer  and browserplayer.
Plugins work for all types of show but Liveshows need special treatment.

API
----
Plugins are organised as Python Classes. The class name must be identical to the name of the file that contains it (without .py)
The plugin to be used by a track is specified in the xxxxx.cfg file. The path of this file is in the Plugin Config file of a track.

Each instance of a Player creates an instance of a Plugin which calls __init__

__init__(....) allows the context to be passed to the plugin. Most of the arguments are unlikely to be used. You can initialise your own state variables in __init__.
-----------------
Arguments of __init__ :
    root -
    the top level window - not of great use to a track plugin.
    
    canvas -
    the Tkinter canvas on which all displayed output of the Player is written. A plugin could write to the canvas directly and return the provided file path (see krt_time.py)
    
    plugin_params -
    dictionary of the parameters defined in the plugin configuration file that called this plugin
    e.g. plugin_params['line2'] will return 'text added from cfg file' for this example.
    
    show_params -
    dictionary of show parameters, definitions in /pipresents/pp_definitions.py.
    
    track_params -
    dictionary of track parameters, definitions in /pipresents/pp_definitions.py
    
    pp_dir -
    path of pipresents directory
    
    pp_home -
    path of data home directory
    
    pp_profile -
    path of profile directory


load
------
  Code that determines or modifies the track to be played must be in the method load(self,track_file,liveshow,type).

  load is executed when a track is loaded, which may be some time before it is shown.
  The main purpose of the method is to modify a, or provide an alternative, track file.
  
  load has the following arguments:

    a. liveshow
    True if the plugin has been called from a liveshow or artliveshow. If called from a liveshow track_file contains rubbish
    and type is obtained from the .cfg file that specified the plugin. This is because the plugin is
    the track, not associated with another type of track.

    b. type
    The type of track, this determines the player that will play the track. Currently audio, video, image, web, message
    

    c. track_file

    If the plugin is called from within a liveshow or artliveshow then this will be rubbish

    If the plugin is caled from ant other type of show then:
    
    For type='message' - the argument contains the message text that would be  displayed.

    For all other players - The full path of the file specified in the Location field of the profile entry for this track.

    Note: The track file/message eventually used will be that whose path is returned by the plugin.

 load returns a tuple: status,message, filepath, draw_interval

    1. status -
    'normal','error'.  Return 'normal' if OK. 'error' is for fatal errors and will cause Pi Presents to exit after displaying the error message.
    The plugin should deal nicely with non-fatal errors, like temporary loss of the internet connection, and return status='normal'
    
    2. message -
    an error message for status='error'
    
    3. filepath -
    Full path of the track file to  be used by the player or the message text. Blank if no file is to be played, wher thsi is allowed by the player.
    The type of file specified should be compatible with the underlying player (omxplayer etc.)

  4. draw_interval -
 This integer enables direct drawing to the canvas using Tkinter canvas methods.
   <0 disable drawing
    0 draw once at the start of the track
    >0 draw repeatedly at the specified interval (mS)


show(self)
-------------
    show is executed when the track is displayed. The plugin code must have this method but usually it will be a dummy.
    It has been included to allow advanced users execute code concident with showing.

draw(self)
-------------
    draw allows user code to repetitively draw on the canvas while the track is showing.
    draw is executed when the track is first shown and then at intervals defined by draw_interval
    The plugin must contain this method if draw_interval >=0
    for more detail see krt_time.py

 hide(self)
 -------------
    The plugin code must  have the method  hide(self)
    It is executed at the end of a track.
    This method should be used to delete any temporary files.


EXAMPLE
-------------
An example follows. It demonstrates the principles and is very long as it addresses all possibilities.
Usually a plugin will be writtin for a single track type.
